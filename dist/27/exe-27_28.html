<h3>Exercise 27.28</h3>

<div class="exercise-content">
  <p>Prove directly from the definitions of maximal and prime ideals that every maximal ideal of a commutative ring
    \( R \) with unity is a prime ideal.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="exercise-solution">
  <p>
    Let \( M \) be a maximal ideal and let \( ab \in M \) for some \( a, b \in R \)
    and let \(a \notin M \). Consider the ideal \( \langle M \cup \{a\} \rangle \). 
    We have a recipe for it as a submodule to express an element: 
    a finite sum of products of elements from \( M \) and \( \{ a \} \).
    That is, the submodule elements are \( m_1 + m_2 a^k + a^{l_1} + \ldots + a^{l_r} \).
    Since \( M \) is an ideal, the second summand is in \(M \) so this reduces to
    \( m + a^{l_1} + \ldots + a^{l_r} \). As \(M \) is maximal, the ideal 
    \( \langle M \cup \{a\} \rangle \) is the whole ring \( R \) so it contains \( 1 \).
    Now \( b = mb + a^{l_1}b + \ldots + a^{l_r}b = mb + a^{l_1-1}ab + \ldots + a^{l_r-1}ab\).
    Both \( mb \) and \( ab \) are in \( M \), so all summands are in \( M \),
    so \( b \in M \).
    <br>
    We didn't use the Hint: 
    <div class="hint">
      Argue that the smallest ideal \( \{ ra + m | r \in R, m \in M\} \)
      containing \( a \) and \( M \) must contain \( 1 \). Express \( 1 \) as 
      \( ra + m \) and multiply by \( b \).
    </div>
    as we never had the theory - the recipe for elements of ideal augmented by an element.
